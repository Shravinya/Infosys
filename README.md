# 🚗 Task 1: Car Sales Data Cleaning & EDA

## 📌 Objective
Clean the car sales dataset and perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns in price, mileage, manufacturers, and fuel types.

## 🛠️ Steps
- Loaded dataset from Google Drive.  
- Cleaned column names, handled duplicates & missing values.  
- Converted numeric fields (`year_of_manufacture`, `mileage`, `price`, `engine_size`).  
- Performed EDA using histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, lineplots, and heatmaps.  

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Newer cars retain higher resale prices.  
- Diesel cars show higher mileage but lower resale value than petrol cars.  
- Price decreases with mileage (depreciation trend).  
- Cars older than 2015 have a significant price drop.
